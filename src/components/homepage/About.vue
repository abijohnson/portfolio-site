                I am a 2020 graduate of Western Oregon University (B.S in Computer Science). I currently live in Oklahoma, and enjoy remote work. When Iâ€™m not working, I am probably reading, taking care of my plants, or spending time with my sweet fiance.  Tech has always been a love of mine, and so has design. Hence why I love front-end development. Being both a UX/UI designer and developer, I design with the devs in mind and I dev with the designers in mind. I enjoy what I do, and enjoy working with people who do too!
