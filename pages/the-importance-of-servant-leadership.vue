                    Servant leadership. It is a term that almost sounds backwards, but implementing it as a leader is crucial to
                    not just your team's success, but your success too. There are many ways you can define "Servant Leader", but here
                    are two of mine:

                <ul class="list-disc pl-12 py-3 space-y-2">
                    <li>A servant leader is someone “whose actions and motivations reflect a selfless commitment to a cause, an organization, or their teammates.”  <span class="text-zinc-400 italic">(Kouzes & Posner)</span></li>
                    <li>Servant leaders empower, not overpower. Providing them with tools and resources for them to succeed. Helping them develop
                        professionally and personally. <span class="text-zinc-400 italic">(Maxwell Leadership Executive Podcast)</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Typically what we understand leadership to be is
                    a top-down model. One person at the top, commanding everyone at the bottom. That's pretty normal on
                    most teams, regardless of the field. And it works, right? Well, what if I told you that flipping that top-down
                    model to a down-top model (aka: leading from behind) would actually cause you and your team to excel as not only a unit, but
                    as individuals?

                Why servant leadership?
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3">
                Something that easily slips from our minds as leaders is this: We are leading humans.
                And if the only time that you remember that is when one of your team members makes a mistake, it is time
                to make a shift in your thinking. When we lead from the bottom, and seek to serve others before ourselves,
                we really bring back to our remembrance that hey, we are leading real life people, just like ourselves.
                Yes, of course we want to see our company succeed and of course we want to meet deadlines, but if we
                prioritize those ahead of our people the results are as follows:
                <ul class="list-disc pl-12 py-3 space-y-2">
                    <li>Burnt out team members</li>
                    <li>Lack of loyalty in the team</li>
                    <li>A team who really just wants to punch in and punch out (Leading to a lack of quality products)</li>
                    <li>People who don't really care to stick around or go an extra mile</li>
                </ul>
                You see, when we lead in the "classic" way (where we are disconnected from those under us,
                expect them to work with excellence because "well they get a paycheck from us!", and expect them to
                improve and grow all on their own) I believe we fail them as a leader. However, if we take the title "leader"
                as an opportunity to come alongside those under us and ask "Hey, how best can I help you today? What can I
                do that will help you win today?" we show them that we care, and that in turn will actually help them care about and enjoy what they do
                (and in turn, building better products and driving
                better results)

                    <li><span class="font-semibold">Intention.</span> Servant leadership begins from the inside. People can practically
                    smell your intentions, no matter how good you think you are at hiding them!</li>
                    <li><span class="font-semibold">Presence.</span> "Focused intention on the person you are with." Be fully engaged
                    with the teammate or person you are with. People will be able to tell when you check out, and you will not
                    get your intent across when you are disengaged.</li>
                    <li><span class="font-semibold">Provision.</span> Ask yourself this: How am I providing for and equipping the people on my team?
                    </li>

                        but don't be so focused on what is next that you don't acknowledge the accomplishments your people are making now.

                Why this is uniquely important in the tech space
            </p>
            <div class="pt-3 space-y-2">
                <p>
                    Let me make that a bit more concise: Why it is uniquely important as a Senior/Principal/Staff engineer. Or,
                    really any role where you have gained the expertise to be where you are, and have people under you who desire to
                    know what you know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's take this situation for example: You are a senior dev. You have a junior dev under you, and they are
                    stuck on what sounds like to you a simple problem. You have 2 choices: A) Get frustrated. I mean, they should know
                    these things. This is the 4th time they have slowed things down, don't they know how to figure things out for themselves? B)
                    Get understanding. At the end of the day, they want to be where you are. They want to know how to fix this problem,
                    and while they could eventually get it themselves, if you would just come along side them and use it as a teaching/serving
                    moment, they probably won't run into it again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you see how servant leadership actually will save you time and money? People don't care how much you know until they know
                    how much you care. And when they know you care, they will stick around. They will go that extra mile. They will put in the
                    quality work you need them to, and they will be happy to do it. Why? Because when we lead from behind, they feel seen, empowered, trusted,
                    and excited.

                What I am not saying
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3">
                I am most certainly not saying we need to do everything for everyone, and never let anyone figure out things
                for themselves. We don't let ourselves be led by feelings and pity, or let ourselves be doormats. <span class="font-semibold">Servant
                leadership is not a position of weakness, but a position of strength.</span> You are a warrior for your people. You are going before them, knocking down barriers

                Final thoughts
            </p>
            <p class="pt-3">
                There's a good quote that goes something like this: "Don't grade my paper, help me get the A!". When you help your
                team members get "A"s, you are forming a team that eventually becomes incredibly productive, resourceful, and delivers quality results every single time.
                When we implement servant leadership in the tech space, we cultivate our culture of learning, which is uniquely
                vital to us as this is the one of the fastest evolving industries in the world.
