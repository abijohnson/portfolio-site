                    Tech has been a love of mine since I can remember, but so has art. When I figured out that I could combine
                    the two with the career path called "Front-End Developer", I was thrilled.

                <p>
                    In 2018 I attended Western Oregon University, and earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2020 (the best year to graduate, right?).
                    Shortly after, I had the privilege of beginning my career on a small, tight-knit startup team. While on that team, I began a UX/UI Designer role
                    in tandem with my Front-End Development role, which gave me not only a unique perspective on the front-end, but a passion for
                    pixel-perfect implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm on the lookout for my next role. What am I looking for? A team that can foster growth, success, and creativity. Nothing
                    gets me more excited than the ability to learn something new, and make meaningful contributions to a growing team. And by meaningful
                    contributions, I do also mean the occasional dad-joke.
